# Advance Linux

This repo contains code samples from [TLPI](http://man7.org/tlpi/) and [APUE](http://www.apuebook.com/apue3e.html) books. I have added helper scripts to enable running through the course even on non-linux environments.

Disclaimer: I don't own code in the `apue.3e` and `tlpi-dist` directories.

## Setup

* Clone the repository - `git clone git@github.com:AgarwalConsulting/AdvanceLinux.git`
* Run `./scripts/download.sh`
